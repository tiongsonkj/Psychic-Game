	<!-- Pseudocode:

	Computer asks: Guess what letter I'm thinking of {
		user types in a letter
	}

	User gets 9 guesses. 
	If user presses wrong letter, then "guests left" goes down 1.
	Computer shows user what he has guessed so far.

	If user guesses wrong letter on 9th try, then "Losses" goes up 1.
	
	If user guesses right letter within 9 attempts, then "Wins" goes up 1.
